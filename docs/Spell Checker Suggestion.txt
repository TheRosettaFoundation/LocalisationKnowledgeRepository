Spell Checker Suggestion
========================

Overview
========
The spell checker that seems to be the most guided to what the LKR is trying to achieve is
the GNU Aspell spell checker. It contains a spell checker that searches text for spelling
errors and returns a list of suggestions (if any suggestions are found). As the LKR is 
designed to improve source language files the suggestions fit in with the goals of the LKR.

Implementation
==============
The Aspell spell checker has a command line interface. I suggest using it in pipe mode by 
passing the neccessary segments to it via the pipe ('|') operator. The results are sent to
standard out stream. Output comes in multiple forms:
	1. If the segment does not contain a spelling error the line returned contains only a '*'
	2. If the segment contains a word not found in the dictionary then the line returned 
		contains an `&', a space, the misspelled word, a space, the number of near misses, 
		the number of characters between the beginning of the line and the beginning of the 
		misspelled word, a colon, another space, and a list of the suggestions separated by 
		commas and spaces.
	3. If the segment contains a word not found in the dictionary and there are no suggestions 
		available then the line returned contains a `#', a space, the misspelled word, a space, 
		and the number of characters between the beginning of the line and the beginning of the 
		misspelled word.
Each sentence of text input is terminated with an additional blank line, indicating that Aspell 
has completed processing the input line. Recommendations that would be generated by the LKR 
could contain the mis-spelled word followed by the list of suggested replacements generated by
the spell checker. For more information on the command line interface using pipe mode see
